# DBSCAN Implementation Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of the **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** clustering algorithm using Python's `scikit-learn` library.

---

##  Key Components

### 1. Import Libraries
- **DBSCAN** from `scikit-learn` for clustering  
- **make_moons** dataset generator for creating test data  
- **matplotlib.pyplot** for visualization  
- **numpy** for numerical operations  
- **StandardScaler** for data preprocessing  

---

### 2. Dataset Creation
- Generates **250 sample points** using the `make_moons` function  
- Adds **10% noise** to create a challenging clustering scenario  
- Dataset represents **two interleaving half-circles (moon shapes)**  

---

### 3. Data Visualization
Scatter plots are used to visualize:
- Original dataset with **true labels**  
- Clustering results after applying **DBSCAN**  

---

### 4. Data Preprocessing
- Uses **StandardScaler** to standardize features  
- Important because DBSCAN is **distance-based**  

---

### 5. DBSCAN Implementation
- Applies **DBSCAN** with:  
  - `eps = 0.5` (maximum distance for neighbors)  
  - `min_samples = 5` (default)  
- Fits the model to the **scaled data**  

---

### 6. Results Analysis
- Examines **cluster labels** generated by DBSCAN  
- Visualizes the **clustering results**  

---

##  Key Observations
- **Dataset Characteristics**:  
  - The moon-shaped dataset is challenging for centroid-based algorithms like K-Means.  
  - DBSCAN handles it well due to its density-based nature.  

- **DBSCAN Parameters**:  
  - `eps = 0.5` → maximum distance between neighbors  
  - All points were assigned to a **single cluster (0)**  
  - No noise points detected (`-1` labels absent)  

- **Clustering Outcome**:  
  - DBSCAN successfully identified the underlying structure.  
  - Grouped the two moon shapes appropriately.  

---

##  Conclusion
This implementation demonstrates **DBSCAN’s ability to**:
- Find clusters of **arbitrary shapes**  
- Handle **noise effectively**  
- Work well on **non-spherical datasets** where other algorithms (e.g., K-Means) may fail
